This code sets up an array of possible options and lets the suer select which they would prefer

There are constraints on the different things being presented, an option can not be displayed twice in the same selection group, nor can it be seen if it was in the last selection group

After all the selections have been done the information is stored into local memory, then that info is presented to the user in the form of a results table and a results graph

The colors for the page were pulled from an image in the video game Subnautica pushed through a color grabber to give a more styled look because the picture was quite cool
